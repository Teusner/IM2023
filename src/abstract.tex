	\subsection*{Biography}

	Quentin Brateau received a double degree in Mobile Robotics, from ENSTA Bretagne, and in Dynamical Systems and Signals, from Polytech Angers, in 2021. He is currently a Ph.D. student at ENSTA Bretagne, in the Lab-STICC laboratory, on the control of torpedo-like AUV. His research is focused on the control and state estimation of such robots in constrained environments.

	\subsection*{Abstract}

	The union of contractors is a fundamental operation in contractor programming. It is used to build more complex contractors from fundamental ones. However, the union of adjacent contractors can reveal the common boundary between the two contractors, which is not consistent with the set union as defined in set theory. This problem is particularly noticeable in geometric contractors, which are a class of contractors based on geometric constraints, and in which contractors are often adjacent. This presentation will focus on the problem statement, and provide some insight to build contractors on the union instead of relying on the union of contractors.
